This is a project from the course "System programming" I have taken in my second year in Ben Gurion University.
It is a collaboration with Tsuri Farhana, we both contributed for this project.
The main goal was to build client-server based on thread-per-client and a reactor, we were also using TCP.
*we were provided with the skeleton files of the main server
